## First Things First - What You'll Need

Prior to running this project, here are the pre-reqs you'll need. Please make sure you've got these installed on your computer:

* **Node.js:** This runs the app. You'll want version 16 or later to keep things smooth.
* **npm** Node Package Manager.
* **PostgreSQL:** This is where we keep all our animal sighting data. Make sure it's up and running! I provide some mock data to get you started in my db.sql file.
* **JEST** For running unit tests.
* Keep in mind I use VS Code for my code editor and a Mac Book.

## Installation Instructions

Here's part one of my installation instructions to get the app running on your machine:

1.  **Grab the Code**

First, you'll need to clone my repo here:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/courjimen/blog-app/tree/main
```

2.  **Get the Server and Client Folders Ready**

Cd into server and run this command: 
```bash
npm install express cors pg nodemon
```

Cd into client and run this command: 
```bash
npm install react react-router-dom @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons @fortawesome/react-fontawesome
```

Return to root directory and install jest and concurrently run these two commands:

```bash
npm install concurrently --save-dev
npm install jest --save-dev
```

Once everything is installed you can run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Part two, you'll need to do in your terminal via Postgres 

3. **Set Up the Database Locally with Postgres!**

* **Create a Database:** You'll need to create a PostgreSQL database. Using `psql` to create your tables locally. Sign in (make sure postgres is installed!) with the following command:

```bash
psql postgres
```
Then follow the steps in my `db.sql` file and copy/paste each line of code into your terminal.

* **Insert database credentials:** Open up `server/db.js` and input your database connection details (username, password, etc.).

5.  **Fire It Up! üî•**

Finally, we're ready to run the app! Back in the main project directory, type:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start both the server and the client. You should be able to see the app in your browser at `http://localhost:5173/`. The server will be running on `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Demo
Here's what you can expect to see upon opening (using the starter code provided for your databases):
![](./client/images/home.png)

You can also filter your animals by checking the healthy only box:
![](./client/src/assets/healthyfilter.png)

Moving along to the form you have the calendar pop up feature to capture time/date:
![](./client/src/assets/addSighting.png)

After inserting all the required information you can submit (please note if you want more animals that the three provided you can add more to the starter code provided in the db.sql file):

| Animals | db.sql Code |
| ------ | ------|
| ![](./client/src/assets/form.png) | ![](./client/src/assets/db.png)

You should see your sighting attached to the bottom of the table:

And voila! You're all set üéâ Thank you for checking out my work.
