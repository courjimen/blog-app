We could spend an entire blog talking about each of these attributes, but I''m only going to focus on one, being kind. If we''re honest, a lot of us aren''t kind; whether it be to ourselves, our friends or family, our partners, whoever. Humanity has a natural proclivity to evil. It literally goes against our nature to be kind to others. Loving yourself, let alone other people, is something that should be simple but oftentimes it''s not because we forget to root our love in God. When your ‚Äúlove‚Äù is based on approval, materialism, or worldly things, it makes it conditional. Transactional. The one thing love should never do is take. I''ve learned over the years that true unconditional love is rooted in kindness. Now, that doesn''t mean you give, give, and give without having boundaries. There''s a difference between being kind and letting people take advantage of you. When I think about pure love, I think about Jesus‚Äôs sacrifice‰∏Ä what he gave to us.');
